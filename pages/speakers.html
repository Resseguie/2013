			<div class='title'>Meet Whurley</div>
	<p>He's been called a visionary systems theorist, a mad scientist, and an evil genius (International Genius).  What he is, is innovative.  Over his 20-year career, whurley has demonstrated a talent for innovation and a passion for open source software.  In 2010 he co-founded Chaotic Moon, a leading mobile development and strategy company, and quickly built a portfolio of A-list clients.  Names like Microsoft, CBS Sports, Sanrio, Pizza Hutt, and News Corp, for whom Chaotic Moon developed the first iPad-only digital newspaper. </p>
	<p>In 2011 he could have stood put.  Instead he doubled down, helping launch Chaotic Moon Labs to focus on "innovation on demand." As General Manager of the lab in 2012, he created what Wired Magazine described as "the best of CES," an all-terrain skateboard controlled by hand motions.  Powered by an Xbox Kinect&trade; and a Samsung tablet, the board achieved an exhilarating top speed of 32 mph. For dessert, he built a mind-controlled version that Jason Bradbury, host of the Europe's The Gadget Show, said was "...like something out of a science fiction movie" and "comic book crazy." </p>
	<p>He then created a rapid prototype of the shopping cart of the future. The Smarter Cart™ not only guided customers to items at Whole Foods' flagship store, it also scanned their food to help manage their dietary needs, notify them of FDA food recalls, and accelerate their check-out.</p>
	<p>Today whurley keeps the world's top brands decades ahead of the curve, predicting not only the next iteration, but delivering on the demands of the next generation.</p>

			<div class='title'>Meet Sylvia</div>
			<p>"Super-Awesome” Sylvia Todd started making and tinkering with things when she was 7, and always loved to try out new things. One year after visiting Maker Faire, she and her dad were inspired to create a web-show about making things called “Sylvia’s Super-Awesome Maker Show”, where she shows kids and adults that making things can be fun, easy, and more rewarding than just buying something purpose built. Now 12 years old and millions of views later, she’s covered everything from hobby rocketry, to sewable soft circuits, to Arduino. The show has garnered attention from parents and educators the world over, finding that something about the show gets students interested in making things and learning something along the way. In July 2013, she successfully launched her very first educational robotic kit on Kickstarter, the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1894919479/super-awesome-sylvias-watercolorbot-0">WaterColorBot</a>.

			<div class='title'>Meet Todd</div>
			<p>Though James Todd has always been a tinkerer, he started his family early and somehow figured that it wasn't something he could continue with his young children. After a visit to Maker Faire, it was clear that family life and electronics, programming and making this wasn't just possible, but should be encouraged at every step. Eventually working with his oldest daughter Sylvia at the age of 8, they decided to create a youtube video in the style of a show about building a kit, and take it back to maker faire. The video became an overnight success, and after only a year had blossomed into a second life, sending his family across the country to talk about the wonders of making. Though he's never been to college, and didn't even finish high school, he writes code for fun and profit, and tries his best to share as much as he has time for at <a href="http://github.com/techninja">github.com/techninja</a>.</p>
