			<div class='title'>Meet Whurley</div>
	<p>He's been called a visionary systems theorist, a mad scientist, and an evil genius (International Genius).  What he is, is innovative.  Over his 20-year career, whurley has demonstrated a talent for innovation and a passion for open source software.  In 2010 he co-founded Chaotic Moon, a leading mobile development and strategy company, and quickly built a portfolio of A-list clients.  Names like Microsoft, CBS Sports, Sanrio, Pizza Hutt, and News Corp, for whom Chaotic Moon developed the first iPad-only digital newspaper. </p>
	<p>In 2011 he could have stood put.  Instead he doubled down, helping launch Chaotic Moon Labs to focus on "innovation on demand." As General Manager of the lab in 2012, he created what Wired Magazine described as "the best of CES," an all-terrain skateboard controlled by hand motions.  Powered by an Xbox Kinect&trade; and a Samsung tablet, the board achieved an exhilarating top speed of 32 mph. For dessert, he built a mind-controlled version that Jason Bradbury, host of the Europe's The Gadget Show, said was "...like something out of a science fiction movie" and "comic book crazy." </p>
	<p>He then created a rapid prototype of the shopping cart of the future. The Smarter Cartâ„¢ not only guided customers to items at Whole Foods' flagship store, it also scanned their food to help manage their dietary needs, notify them of FDA food recalls, and accelerate their check-out.</p>
	<p>Today whurley keeps the world's top brands decades ahead of the curve, predicting not only the next iteration, but delivering on the demands of the next generation.</p>

			<div class='title'>Meet Raquel</div>
			<p>Raquel "@rockbot" V&egrave;lez is a really weird engineer.  First, she received her BS in mechanical engineering from Caltech.  Then she (played with | built | programmed | psychoanalyzed) robots for 8 years, at places like NASA JPL, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and various universities in Europe.  She took a break to do that startup thing as a co-founder and CTO... but came to her senses and found a new life online as a web developer.  Raquel got her start as a Developer at Skookum Digital Works; she is now an engineer at Storify in San Francisco, working with an amazing team of people to navigate and define the intersection between journalism and social media.</p>

			<p>In her off time, you can find her baking, hacking on node.js, and speaking.  Also, hanging out with her hilarious husband and two cats dressed in dog suits.  She's online at <a href="http://raquelvelez.com">http://raquelvelez.com</a></p>
