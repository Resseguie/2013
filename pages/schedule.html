	<h3>Thursday December 5th, 2013</h3>
	
	<h4>Opening Reception at Falcon's Nest :: 7:00PM - 10:00PM</h4>
	<p>After a long day of travel, join us and your fellow attendees at the local sports bar, <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/AmeliaIsland/Dining/FalconsNest.aspx">The Falcon's Nest</a>. Full of incredible aviation memorabilia, billiard tables, and TVs, the Falcon's Nest has something for everyone - even if just sitting out on the deck strikes your fancy. We will have appetizers available for you to munch on. It is a quick (~2 minute) walk from the hotel and we look forward to seeing you there!</p>



	<h3>Friday December 6th, 2013</h3>
    <h4>Registration, Breakfast, and Coffee/Tea :: 8:00 AM - 10:00AM</h4>
    <p>Meet us in front of the Amelia Ballroom (our main session room in the conference center) for event registration. Grab your bag and badge then head on over for breakfast, coffee/tea, and some great discussions.</p>
	<h4>Opening Remarks and Introductions from the RobotsConf Team :: 9:00AM - 9:30AM</h4>
	<p>Conference introductions and a quick overview of how RobotsConf will work (for those of you that aren't reading this schedule). We will introduce you to the staff and the experts we have assembled at the event to help you build amazing things throughout the next 36 hours. These individuals will be your guides on the journey towards hardware enlightenment, take full advantage of the time you have with them!</p>

    <h4>Visionary Lectures and Leaders :: 9:30AM - 11:30AM</h4>
	<p>What is a conference without a couple talks that show you the world from a different perspective? RobotsConf will kick off with a series of high-impact, visionary lectures from some of the greatest thought leaders of the Maker Movement. Individuals will present not just ideas, but projects and technologies that they have constructed. These talks will provide the frame of reference for the rest of the day and hopefully the rest of your maker career. </p>
        
    
    <h4>Lunch :: 11:30AM - 12:45PM</h4>
	<p>Food is the fuel that will drive you through the next couple hours. Fill up on food and conversations about hardware hacking and robots before we enter into the workshop component of the event. The lunch will have vegan-friendly options and strict vegan meals available upon request.</p>

	<h4>Small Group Breakout :: 12:45PM - 1:00PM</h4>
    <p>The remainder of the scheduled events for the day will be done in small groups working through specific workshops. Small groups will be broken into and presented with their specific schedule of workshop times. Groups will move from workshop to workshop in order to quickly get exposure and insight into the specialized topics at each workshop. The groups will be assigned randomly in order to encourage you to meet new attendees at RobotsConf, possibly even with people you may want to build your robots.</p>

    <h4>Workshops :: 1:00PM - 6:00PM</h4>
    <p>Around the great room of RobotsConf we will have specialized workshop stations set up for the following topics. 
    <ul>
        <li>Station 1: 3D Printing and Modern Fabrication</li>
        <li>Station 2: Drones and Autonoumous/Semi-Autonomous Vehicles</li>
        <li>Station 3: Microcontrollers and the Internet of Things</li>
        <li>Station 4: Home Automation</li>
        <li>Station 5: Electronic Fundamentals</li>
        <li>Station 6: Soldering, Wiring, and Prototyping</li>
        <li>Station 7: Robotics and ROS</li>
        <li>Station 8: HackerSpaces</li>
        <li>Station 9: Interaction Interfaces (Makey-Makey, Kinect, LeapMotion)</li>
        <li>Station 10: Fashion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They are designed to provide you with a quick, hands-on, rapid fire overview of each of the major segments within the Maker movement. Your group will round robin through all of the staions such that by 6:00PM, you should be knowledgeable about all of the areas and hopefully you will have identified a small subset that deeply interest or excite you. The goal of these workshops isn't necessarily to explain everything in 30 minutes (an impossible task) but to give you enough insight to know if you need to return to the workshop later to accomplish your robotic goals! Think of it as speed dating for the maker movement.</p>
    
    <h4>Open Hack :: 6:00PM - 1:00AM</h4>
    <p>If you have an idea and a team, you can start breadboarding and soldering items together to build your invention, otherwise use this time to form a team (or go solo, that is perfectly fine!) and come up with what you are going to build. For those so inclined, we will be hosting the first of several sumobot tournaments starting at 10:30PM with bots controlled by our local high-level language experts. The tournament is a great way to start down a path of building something that you can then compete and evolve over time. For an example of what a sumobot tournament will look like, see below:</p>

    </center>
        <p>During the open hack, you will have you have access to the best possible people in your preferred language there to help (and independence for when you don't) as well as all of the workshop experts. There will be drones available to hack on, solder stations ready to melt metal, and more servos than you can possibly imagine. The evening will buzz with the excitement and energy that only comes when you are building your very own electronic inventions.</p>
    
    <h4>Evening Social Event :: 8:00PM - 11:00PM</h4>
    <p>RobotsConf is not just about soldering components together, but also about bringing people together. As such, we want to provide you with a great evening social event, while still allowing you to participate in the Open Hack night (or just discuss and watch). Right in the same area as the open hack event, we will be hosting one of our amazing social events so if you need a break from hardware hacking, you can do that or just grab a quick refreshment and get back at it! If you want to ake a complete break from the day, there will be fires going around the heated pool... so there is that option.</p>

	<h3>Saturday December 7th, 2013</h3>
    
    <p><center><img src='/img/building.jpg' alt='Working on my robot'/></center></p>
    <h4>Open Hack :: 9:00AM - 3:30PM</h4>
    <p>Continue to hack forward after a refreshing bit of sleep (or pool time, if you prefer) as you race to the finish line and show and tell. We will provide food and refreshments throughout the day so you can stay at the top of your hacking. If you finish early or just want to declare you bot complete, you can go learn more at each of the workshop stations or offer to support any of the sumobot teams as the battle to the championships. We want everyone to have a great time and to learn and experience as much as possible while we have the experts and hardware readily available, so if you have time and desire to start another project, please get to it! You are only confined by your motivation and the amount of time we have the space.</p>
    
    
    <h4>Lunch :: 11:30AM - 12:45PM</h4>
	<p>The final fill up during the open hack sessions, use this time wisely to either continue building or spying on your competition. The lunch will have vegan-friendly options and strict vegan meals available upon request.</p>
        
    <p><center><img src='/img/cup.png' alt='The RobotsConf Cup'/></center></p>
	<h4>RobotsConf Show and Tell Tournament :: 3:30PM - 5:00PM</h4>
    <p>Teams will be grouped based on their general topic of implementation and present their creations. The smaller group will vote a winner of the category which will go on to present before the entire audience of RobotsConf for the coveted RobotsConf Cup. Also, the final winners of the sumobot competition will also be announced as well as provided with a bit of time to decsribe their strategy to victory. The overall winning teams from the open hack and the sumobot competition will receive prizes for their efforts, so you definitely want to make something amazing!</p>
    
    <h4>Closing Keynote :: 5:00PM - 5:45PM</h4>
    <p>We end RobotsConf with a very inspirational and uplifting keynote from one of the preeminent leaders in the Maker Movement. Details of this talk still to come.</p>
    
    
    <h4>Final Remarks and Family Photo: 5:45PM - 6:15PM</h4>
    <p>The final remarks from the RobotsConf team, a thank you to all sponsors, workshop guides, language experts, and speakers. We finish it all off with our famous family photograph to provide the lasting image of those that survived RobotsConf 2013!</p>

    <h4>The Big Bot BBQ :: 7:00PM - 11:00PM</h4>
    <p>After spending almost a solid 48 hours building robots, printing plastic creations, and controlling drones - it is finally time to put down our serial ports and enjoy each others company. Enjoy an absolutely amazing evening out on the marsh with all of your new roboticist friends while you dine on local cuisine. You don't have to worry about walking their, you can take the local bus system - or if you want a rather nice bike ride, you can also bike there. See you there!</p>
