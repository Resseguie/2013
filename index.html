<h1><i>What is RobotsConf?</i></h1>
<p>RobotsConf is a revolutionary technology event for software developers to get an efficient and effective deep dive into the exciting world of hardware development on August 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup>, 2013. If you are a Ruby, Python, JS or any other high level language developer that is interested in the Maker Movement, but unsure where to start -- this event is designed for you. We will have experts in each high level language in attendance and available as well as many of the incredible makers who are already changing the world. With hands-on sessions covering <em>drones</em>, <em>3D Printing</em>, <em>microcontrollers</em>, and the <em>Internet of Things</em>, this is the only two day event that will take you from a software developer to a Maker.</p>
<p>Organized by the same team as <a href="/#curators">JSConf</a>, RobotsConf is purposefully being constructed to bring developers of all high level programming languages together for the love and education of hardware. The blossoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_subculture">Maker movement</a> and hackerspaces are amazing, but they can easily be a little scary or daunting to most software developers. This shouldn't be the case, which is why we created this event and we cannot wait for you to join us, in Florida, to build robots (and drones and other incredible things)! <a href="http://tickets.robotsconf.com/">Register now</a> for RobotsConf, overcome your fear of hardware, and become the next generation of maker.</p>
